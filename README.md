# Python-Monte-Carlo-Physics-Simulation

This is a physics project that analysed the performance of various Monte Carlo sampling techniques and identified the best technique
to simulate a nuclear physics experiment. This project also analysed the advantages and fallbacks of various python statistical analysis 
packages, such as statesmodels, numpy and scipy.
